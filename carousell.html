                    <h6 class="caseheader">Conclusion</h6>
                        <p>Redesigning the Carousel mobile application was an extremely rewarding experience for me as my first UI/UX project, giving me a glimpse into the world of UI/UX. This personal project has blossomed a deep appreciation for the non-linear rigorous design processes and a love for the process itself.</p>
                        <p>With the major time constraints of this personal project, I had to skip some design processes in order to deliver on time. Here are some of the things I would like to have done given enough time, and the learning points I have gained:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Conduct a deeper analysis.</strong> I feel that while there were many insights gained from sorting out the Google Play Store reviews, I am unable to fully ascertain the full legitimacy of my insights. I shifted my research strategy to prioritize quantity in the shortest time possible, pushing me to use Google Play Store reviews as my main research source.</li>
                            <li><strong>Perfection stifles Creativity.</strong> During my wireframing process, I was brainstorming more in my mind than drawing the ideas out. I believe that there could have been more possible designs if I had not focused on perfecting my wireframes. I will put in place ideation systems for future projects to facilitate my wireframing process, for example by making myself ideate one interface version every 1 or 2 minutes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Test my ideas more rigorously.</strong> There was clearly a lack of testing processes and feedback for my prototypes in this project. This lack of user feedback has made me recognize the importance and purpose of design thinking processes such as the Double Diamond approach.</li>
                            <li><strong>Develop an empathy-driven and open mindset.</strong> The feedback for my Hi-Fi Prototype was a humbling moment for me. Having some experience in web development from classes and personal projects, I believed that I could understand their position while designing new features for the Carousell app. That belief lasted up until user testing for the Hi-Fi prototype when the user informed me of the requirement of a Google Maps API in the location tracking function. I was once again reminded of the importance and value of working in a multi-disciplinary team.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <br>
